SHADIX introduces a new bridge architecture where privacy becomes portable.

It connects the Zcash network — long known for its shielded transactions and zk-SNARK privacy model — with Solana’s high-speed programmable environment. Instead of simply wrapping assets, SHADIX translates Zcash’s privacy logic into on-chain proof structures that can operate natively on Solana.

Through its Zero-Knowledge Bridge Layer (ZKBL), SHADIX enables verifiable cross-chain movement of assets without revealing sender, receiver, or amount. Users can deposit ZEC into SHADIX’s vault, generate shielded representations on Solana, and perform swaps, staking, or DeFi interactions — all while keeping transactional data private.

Every bridge event is accompanied by a ZK Relay Proof, ensuring that all actions remain cryptographically valid and publicly auditable without exposing any personal or transaction details. This design preserves Zcash’s privacy integrity while extending its functionality into the broader Solana ecosystem.

SHADIX isn’t just a connector — it’s a privacy infrastructure layer.
By combining Zcash’s cryptographic strength with Solana’s composability, it builds the foundation for a new class of cross-chain applications: anonymous DeFi, stealth NFTs, and shielded liquidity networks.

In a world where transparency is default, SHADIX restores the right to invisible movement — where proof exists, but identity disappears.
