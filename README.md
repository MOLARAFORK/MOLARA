# Codnix

> Build Solana projects using smart modules.

Codnix is a modular development framework on Solana that lets you build on-chain projects like assembling code blocks.  
Instead of wiring everything from scratch, you compose features from ready-to-use modules, generate scaffolding, run checks, and ship.

On-chain V1 is open-sourced in this repository.

## ✨ What is Codnix?

Codnix is designed to make Solana development feel less like wrestling with boilerplate and more like composing a system.

- Treat core on-chain capabilities (tokens, NFTs, roles, governance, staking, etc.) as **modules**.
- Use a **scaffolding engine** to generate project structure and core contract code.
- Run **basic safety checks** before deploying to Devnet, Testnet or Mainnet.

If you understand the business logic, Codnix helps you turn it into runnable Solana code faster.

## 🔧 Core Features

### 1. Modular Project Composition
Codnix organizes common Solana patterns into composable modules:
- Tokens (SPL-style configurations)
- NFTs & collections
- Roles / access control / governance hooks
- Staking / locking / fee routing primitives

You select the modules you need and Codnix generates the project skeleton around them.

---

### 2. Scaffolding & Checks in One Flow
Codnix aims to cover the “from idea to first deployable version” path:

- Generate project structure and core contract scaffolding.
- Wire basic configuration and interface definitions.
- Run essential security checks and logic validation before deployment.

---

## 🔁 Workflow

Codnix’s workflow is intentionally simple and split into two major phases.

### I. Build

1. **Select Modules**  
   Select the modules you need — tokens, NFTs, roles, governance, and more.

2. **Generate Scaffolding**  
   Codnix automatically generates your project structure and core contract scaffolding.

### II. Ship

1. **Run Checks**  
   Run essential security checks and basic logic validation.

2. **Deploy Fast**  
   Deploy your project to Devnet, Testnet, or Mainnet.

## 🚀 Getting Started

> The commands below are a reference template.  
> Adjust them to match the actual CLI / structure as the project evolves.

### Prerequisites

- Rust & Cargo installed
- Solana tool suite installed (`solana --version`)
- (Optional) Anchor installed (`anchor --version`)

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/codnix.git
cd codnix
